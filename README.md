# Embedded Systems

This directory is a collection of projects completed in CS120B - Embedded Systems (UCR Spring 2020).

(Final Project => LCD Racer)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Projects are built with:
* atmega1284p 8 bit microcontroller:
* AVR toolchain.
* ATATMEL-ICE-PCBA

### Compile

To run embedded system code change main.c file in source directory and to test project, change the test.gdb file in the test directory.

After doing so use the makefile to program atmega microcontroller or test your source file.

```
make program
```

```
make test
```

## Episode 1: The Chai Chai Talk Intro

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/Files/Guests/1_Manny.jpg" width = "50%"/>


#### Joined by Manny Garcia

In the first episode of the Chai Chai Talk, we introduce the podcast series itself, as an exploration of the relationship Indian Americans have with music and how it helps them cultivate their identity. American music has an independent culture associated with it. the music you are into, is a conversation starter in and of itself and not restricted to the national boundaries. But the culture associated with Indian music might be inherently alien to some. And therefore we also start with an introduction as to what Indian music tends to be for most Indian Americans. We are joined by Manny Garcia, a fourth year Biology student from Calexico, California who gives an outside perspective. We hope to break the stereotypes that get pushed onto South Asian music and make clearer the diversity in such a large region.

## Episode 2: Growing Up In America Indian

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/Files/Guests/2_Manasi.jpeg" width = "50%"/>

#### Joined by Manasi Soni

In the second episode of the Chai Chai Talk, we introduce the phenomenon of having a dual identity. Being an Indian American often makes it so that we grow up not feeling at home at home. "Immigrant Americans", with the title alone, often regard themselves as different. But if the time ever came to visit where their families came from, their ancestral home is an even bigger unknown. When we grow up in America, we never feel American but when we go to India, we are not treated like Indians. We are joined by Manasi Soni, a third year business major from San Diego, California. She provides insight on what it was like to grow up as an Indian American in America. We hope to paint a clearer picture as to why at some point the question, "...So what are we?", gets asked.

## Episode 3: Giving Our Children A Diluted India 

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/Files/Guests/3_Manasi.png" width = "50%"/>

#### Joined by Manasi Soni

In the third episode of the Chai Chai Talk, we continue our conversation with Manasi Soni. As mentioned before, Manasi is a third year business major from San Diego, California. In the previous episode we admitted a lot of our understanding comes from Indian media (ie: Bollywood). Now we explore how the Bollywood media can never be a faithful representation of Indian culture. And yet it is what we were given and will be one of the few things we are able to carry over from our childhoods into our childrens’. This causes a conundrum when we consider that there is a desire for our children to have a relationship with their Indian heritage. Because the India we have to give to our kids is diluted.

## Episode 4: A Shifting Identity

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/Files/Guests/4_Sarena.jpeg" width = "50%"/>

#### Joined by Sarena Minawala

In the fourth episode of the Chai Chai Talk, we are joined by Sarena Minawala. Sarena is a fourth year business major who grew up in Chino Hills, California, a predominantly white area. In the last episode we brought up the question of how we will give our children a relationship with India without having a strong connection ourselves. In this episode we talk to Sarena who grew up in a household of Indian Americans rather than Indian immigrants. Together we discuss the effects of a non Indian upbringing and the later shift she explored in finding her identity on her own.

## Episode 5: Underground Music Culture 

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/Files/Guests/5_Vishant.jpeg" width = "50%"/>

#### Joined by Vishant Gandhi

In the fifth episode of the Chai Chai Talk, we are joined by Vishant Gandhi. Vishant is a third year Bio-Engineering student from Pleasonton, California. So far in this podcast, most of the Indian music brought up, has been movie-music. Vishant introduces the audience to the underground music culture and how it is growing. As it grows it is starting to get integrated with the movie music itself. But we ask the question just how much it will change and challenge the movie music industry I grew up with.

## Episode 6: Item Song Impact 

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/Files/Guests/6_Sarah.jpeg" width = "50%"/>

#### Joined by Sarah Easow

In the sixth episode of the Chai Chai Talk, we are joined by Sarah Easow. Sarah is a third year Neuroscience student from Fremont, California. We have a very difficult conversation that covers  a wide expanse of topics and is definitely not without controversy. Sarah and I attempt to deconstruct the over sexualization/objectification of women in Bollywood that exists despite the restrictive and conservative image of what woman "should" be in India. This Bollywood culture continues to exist by silently discounting the Indian-ness within their item girls. And a current new trend of putting forward non-Indian item girls to sexualize a different culture while maintaining the "cultured" image of an Indian woman. Additionally we will talk about not being the "right" kind of Indian due to our religion and colorism issues we have seen with Indian culture in our Indian upbringing. This is only the start of a conversation that should be continued on.

## Episode 7: Bollywood Music Evolution 

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/Files/Guests/7_Nihal.jpeg" width = "50%"/>

#### Joined by Nihal Deopura

In the seventh episode of the Chai Chai Talk, we are joined by Nihal Deopura. Nihal is a second year Business major from Fremont, California. So far in the podcast we have explored two main music trends in Bollywood. Popular independent music gets a new skin and inserted into the next big movie. Item songs have grown as an industry and are becoming more prevalent. But there is a third trend that has taken over the music industry. Similar to movie remake culture in Hollywood, songs of the past are given a modern remake and become part of the movie soundtrack. With these three trends taking over movie albums, songs are rarely an original part of the movie that carries the narrative. And so the music evolution is taking Bollywood music away from the culture I grew up with. What impact will that have on the new viewers, and their children?

## Episode 8: Immigrant American Music Expression 

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/Files/Guests/8_Pratyusha.jpeg" width = "50%"/>

#### Joined by Pratyusha Macherla

In the eight and last episode of the Chai Chai Talk, we are joined by Pratyusha Macherla. Pratyusha is a second year Neuroscience major from San Jose, California. Together we explore the Indian college circuit and the music scene that accompanies it. Tune in, for the last time, to hear how Pratyusha and I took part in the South Asian college community and learned to expand our immigrant identities past the boundaries of India itself. Hopefully you will do the same.
